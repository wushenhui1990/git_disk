
How can I replace a newline (\n) using sed?

Use this solution with GNU sed:

sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ /g'
This will read the whole file in a loop, then replaces the newline(s) with a space.

Explanation:

Create a label via :a.
Append the current and next line to the pattern space via N.
If we are before the last line, branch to the created label $!ba ($! means not to do it on the last line as there should be one final newline).
Finally the substitution replaces every newline with a space on the pattern space (which is the whole file).
Here is cross-platform compatible syntax which works with BSD sed (as per @Benjie comment):

sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\n/ /g'


Use tr instead?

tr '\n' ' ' < input_filename
