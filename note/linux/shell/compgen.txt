You can use the bash(1) built-in compgen

compgen -c will list all the commands you could run.
compgen -a will list all the aliases you could run.
compgen -b will list all the built-ins you could run.
compgen -k will list all the keywords you could run.
compgen -A function will list all the functions you could run.
compgen -A function -abck will list all the above in one go.
Check the man page for other completions you can generate.

To directly answer your question:

compgen -ac | grep searchstr
should do what yout want.
