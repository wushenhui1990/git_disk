1 重新载入当前文件：

    :e
    :e! #放弃当前修改，强制重新载入

2 重新载入所有打开的文件：

    :bufdo e 或者 :bufdo :e!
	
To see a list of current buffers, I use:
:ls

To open a new file, I use
:e ../myFile.pl

To switch between all open files, I use
:b myfile
with enhanced tab completion (still set wildmenu).
Note: :b# chooses the last visited file, so you can use it to switch quickly between two files.

How do I close a single buffer (out of many) in Vim?
A word of caution: "w does not stand for write but for wipeout!"
More from manuals:
:bd
Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer) and delete it from the buffer list. If the buffer was changed, this fails, unless when [!] is specified, in which case changes are lost. The file remains unaffected.
If you know what your're doing, you can also use :bw
:bw
Like |:bdelete|, but really delete the buffer.



How to temporarily exit vim and go back
Assuming terminal vim on a flavor of *nix:
To suspend your running vim
control-z
will suspend the process and get back to your shell
fg
will resume (bring to foreground) your suspended vim
To start a new shell
start a subshell using:
:sh
(as configured by)
:set shell?
or
:!bash
followed by:
control-d  (or exit, but why type so much?)
to kill the shell and return to vim
